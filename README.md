# Circular-Array-Deque-Implementation
An implementation of the Deque ADT: CADeque.java, which implements SimpleDeque using a circular array and dynamically resizes its underlying array by doubling the size of the array whenever it is resized.

Also there is a program Timing.java that tests the performance of the implementation. Specifically, it measures the (average) running times of the SimpleDeque operations for a range of instance sizes.
